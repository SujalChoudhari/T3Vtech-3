Renderer:
	-reworking VAOs (only once per mesh and not once per mesh and frame)
	-2D renderer should be faster with a single linked list instead of the current double linked list
	-ordering things in the 2D and 3D render to have a better performance (shader, textures, uniforms should be the priority)

Memory:
	-own engine memory allocator
